<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Please back-up your vault regularly while using this add-on!</strong> </p>

<p>I am a noob in programming, while no occasion of losing notes has happened, I am afraid that it might. As your notes are valuable, please do remember to back up notes. </p>

<p><strong>Versions</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically, it now supports Anki 2.1.26 +. I am unaware whether if supports earlier version, and I wasn't able to test it on Anki 2.1.28 as my laptop is a M1 MacBook Air and Anki 2.1.28 does not open on it. </p>

<p><strong>Expectations</strong></p>

<p>With this add-on, it is expected that you make all your changes in Obsidian (including the deletion, addition, and moving of the files). If you want to edit a file, you can just click on the link in Anki to link back to Obsidian. Instead of deleting files, you should move unused files into the trash folder that you specify at the first level in your vault. Obsidianki will automatically remove them for you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/ankitects">Anki</a> add-on that would import your files from <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> into Anki while preserving the wiki-links. Each file in Obsidianki will be converted to a single note in Anki. It does so by searching through your vault for the file with the name specified and generating an Obsidian url from the path. </p>

<p>Its github page is <a href="https://github.com/wxxedu/obsidianki4">obsidianki4</a>. </p>

<p>This add-on also works with <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229">hierarchical tags</a> to convert the hierarchical tags in Obsidian in the metadata section (<code>tags: [tag1/tag1.1/tag1.1.1, tag2/tag2.1/tag2.1.1]</code>) into anki hierarchical tags. <code>tag1::tag1.1::tag1.1.1</code> and <code>tag2::tag2.1::tag2.1.1</code></p>

<h2>How to Install</h2>

<p>You can install this Add-on by downloading the <code>obsidianki 4.ankiaddon</code> file from the releases section of GitHub and double click on it. </p>

<p>You can also download from AnkiWeb: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/620260832">Obsidianki 4 Addon Page</a>. The code for this add-on is 620260832.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p><strong>Before starting to use, you will have to install Obsidianki's template, without which Obsidianki would not work.</strong> To do so, go to Anki's Add-ons folder, open the folder "Obsidianki 4", and find <code>Obsidianki 4.apkg</code>. Double click on it to install. You can also download it from GitHub. </p>

<p>After you've installed the Add-on, you can open Anki, select <code>Tools</code> -> <code>Obsidianki 4</code>, as shown in the following picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEgy1gmmwz3peljj30u80ncq62.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The following menu will pop-up, which will include the default preferences panel. <strong>NOTE THAT THE SETTINGS IN THIS PANEL ARE ALL DEFAULT SETTINGS</strong>, and you <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> change them regularly, as a change will <strong>AFFECT ALL YOUR NOTES</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEgy1gmpllk0e9nj30rq0zkn1f.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Copy the path of your Obsidian vault into the first field. Note that you will have to use <strong>forward slashes</strong> <code>/</code> instead of backward ones for Obsidianki to function properly. </p>

<p>After you've set the settings (I will explain in the next section), you can click on "Save and Convert", and it will complete the conversion. However, you won't notice a difference. Why? Because Anki's interface is not refreshed. To refresh the interface, you could click on anything in Anki's main interface, and it should be refreshed. </p>

<h2>Default Settings</h2>

<p>Now, let's take a look at the default settings. </p>

<h3>Vault Path</h3>

<p>This place shows the path to your vault. Note that in order for the wiki-links in Anki to link back to Obsidian, you will have to use a path that is actually a vault. If you just copy the path of a folder in the vault, the link function will not work. </p>

<p>Another thing to take especial note of is that you should use <strong>forward slashes</strong> instead of backward ones. </p>

<h3>Templates Folder Name</h3>

<p>The name of the folder in the first level that holds your templates. If specified, the contents in this folder would not be imported to Anki.</p>

<h3>Trash Folder Name</h3>

<p>The name of the folder in the first level that holds your trash. If specified, the contents in this folder would be <strong>erased</strong> when you run the Obsidianki add-on, and the corresponding cards in anki would also be deleted.</p>

<h3>Archive Folder Name</h3>

<p>The name of the folder in the first level that holds your archived file. If specified, corresponding anki cards to the contents in this folder would be deleted in Anki, but the files are still there in Obsidian and would not be deleted. </p>

<h3>Mode</h3>

<p>There are four importing cloze modes in Obsidianki. </p>

<h4><code>word</code> mode</h4>

<p>It generates a card for every cloze. If you have 10 clozes, it generates 10 cards from <code>{{c1::Card 1}}</code> to <code>{{c10::}}</code>.</p>

<h4><code>line</code> mode</h4>

<p>It generates a card for every line. If you have 10 clozes in the first line, they will be <code>{{c1::Card 1}}</code> to <code>{{c10::Card 10}}</code>. If you have 2 more clozes in the second line, they will be <code>{{c2::Card 11}}</code> to <code>{{c2::Card 12}}</code>.</p>

<h4><code>heading</code> mode (Recommended)</h4>

<p>It generates a card for the content under every heading, with the exception of list cards and QA cards (I will explain this below). If you have a file as below:</p>

<p>```markdown</p>

<h1>Heading 1</h1>

<p>Hello <strong>Obsidianki</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the best <strong>Anki</strong> add-on for importing Obsidian files into <strong>Anki</strong>.</p>

<h2>Heading 2</h2>

<p>This is something <strong>interesting</strong>.</p>

<p>Q: What is the best add-on for importing Obsidian files into <strong>Anki</strong>?</p>

<p>A: Obsidianki!</p>

<p>What are the features of Obsidianki?</p>

<ol>
<li>Import files</li>
<li>Preserve wiki links</li>
<li>Convert to Clozes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Heading 3</h2>

<p>This is <strong>Heading 3</strong>.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The "Obsidianki", "Anki" under "Heading 1" will be turned into <code>{{c1::Obsidianki}}</code> and <code>{{c1::Anki}}</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Theoretically, everything under "Heading 2" should be turned into <code>{{c2::...}}</code> cards, right? Not quite, because I have added QA cards and list cards. So, after conversion, the portion under heading to would become:</p>

<p>```markdown</p>

<h2>Heading 2</h2>

<p>This is something <strong>{{c2::interesting}}</strong>.</p>

<p>Q: What is the best add-on for importing Obsidian files into <strong>Anki</strong>?</p>

<p>A: {{c3::Obsidianki!}}</p>

<p>What are the features of Obsidianki?</p>

<ol>
<li>{{c4::Import files}}</li>
<li>{{c5::Preserve wiki links}}</li>
<li>{{c6::Convert to Clozes}}
```</li>
</ol>

<h4><code>document</code> mode</h4>

<p>In the document mode, everything will be converted to <code>{{c1::...}}</code>.</p>

<h3>Type</h3>

<p>There are two types in Obsidianki 4: <code>cloze</code> and <code>basic</code>. Nevertheless, these two types are different from Anki's <code>cloze</code> and <code>basic</code>. </p>

<h4><code>cloze</code></h4>

<p>This type will create visible deletions on the screen. You will be able to see <code>[...]</code> on the screen where you applied cloze.</p>

<h4><code>basic</code></h4>

<p>This type will only create one card, and the cloze deletion would not be visible. </p>

<h3>Conversions</h3>

<h4>Bold to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the bold syntax <code>**bold**</code> to cloze in Anki, while preserving the format. </p>

<h4>Italics to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the italics syntax <code>*italics*</code> to cloze in Anki, while preserving the format. </p>

<h4>Highlight to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the highlight syntax <code>==highlight==</code> to cloze in Anki, while preserving the format. </p>

<h4>Image to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the image syntax <code>![]()</code> to cloze in Anki, while preserving the image. </p>

<h4>Quote to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the quote syntax <code>&gt; this is a quote</code> to cloze in Anki, while preserving format. </p>

<p><strong>Be aware that currently, this has conflicts with the other syntaxes. If you want to leave this option on, you will have to make sure that you apply no other cloze formatting in the quote.</strong> </p>

<h4>QA to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the QA syntax that I created into cloze in Anki. </p>

<p>```markdown
Q: Question</p>

<p>A: Answer
```</p>

<p>```markdown
Q: Question</p>

<p>A: {{c1::Answer}}
```</p>

<h4>List to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This turns any list into <code>Cloze</code>, where each list item is a cloze. </p>

<h4>Inline Code to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the inline code syntax to cloze in Anki, while preserving format. </p>

<h4>Block Code to Cloze:</h4>

<p>This converts the block code syntax to cloze in Anki, while preserving format.</p>

<h2>Individual Settings</h2>

<p>You can also individually specify the settings for each note (file) in the metadata section of your file. The metadata section is the following segment in the very beginning of a document. </p>

<h2>```markdown</h2>

<h2>uid: 4511487055494033182</h2>

<p>```</p>

<p><strong>By the way, Obsidianki will automatically create a metadata section that contains the file's unique id in the file. If you don't want duplicated notes, do not change the uid.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to change the individual importing settings for each file, type it in in the metadata section. You can make this a template in Obsidian:</p>

<h2>```</h2>

<p>mode: heading
type: cloze
bold: True
italics: True
highlight: False
image: True
quote: False
QA: True
list: True
inline code: True</p>

<h2>block code: False</h2>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Special Note</h2>

<h3>About the Development</h3>

<p>I will try my best to develop and maintain this add-on. However, as of right now, I am just a high school student who barely knows any programming. All my knowledge of programming come from my AP Computer Science A class LOL. </p>

<p>I know that my code is pretty bad, so feel free to help me update them. (please do so so that I can learn from you!) I will probably add more comments to my code explaining my thoughts while writing them in the future, just in case you want to know what I did in the code. (I want to do this because I struggled to understand Anki's source code and other Add-ons). While this will not be an add-on writing tutorial and I am by no means good at python, it is my best hopes that sharing my thoughts as a beginner will help other beginners understand better how to write Anki add-ons. This will take some time for me to do, as I need to get back to work and studying, but I am going to spend some time doing so. </p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>I want to thank the creators of Anki and Obsidian for building such beautiful apps. I also want to thank my friend <a href="https://github.com/qiaozhanrong">Anis</a> for helping me with the code. </p>
